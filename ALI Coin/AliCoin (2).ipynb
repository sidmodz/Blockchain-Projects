This project implements a working blockchain model with features such as account management, transaction handling, mining, and a Merkle Tree to secure transactions within blocks.\n","\n","# Core Components and Their Technical Implementation\n","\n","## 1. **Blockchain Structure**\n","The blockchain is implemented as a chain of interconnected blocks, where each block contains:\n","- A list of validated transactions.\n","- A reference to the hash of the preceding block (`previous_hash`), ensuring immutability.\n","- A nonce derived from solving a computationally intensive hash puzzle.\n","- A Merkle Root, derived from the transaction data, to validate integrity.\n","\n","## 2. **Genesis Block**\n","The genesis block serves as the starting point of the blockchain. Unlike other blocks, it has no parent and uses a predefined `previous_hash` of `\"0\"`. It is dynamically created only when:\n","- The blockchain is empty.\n","- There are pending transactions to process.\n","\n","## 3. **Accounts**\n","Accounts in AliCoin are modeled as simple objects with the following attributes:\n","- `id`: A unique identifier for the account.\n","- `balance`: A numeric representation of funds held.\n","- `transactions`: A list of transaction objects associated with the account.\n","\n","Each account interacts with the blockchain by sending and receiving funds via transactions. Balances are updated atomically during transaction validation to prevent race conditions.\n","\n","## 4. **Transactions**\n","Transactions are immutable objects that encapsulate:\n","- `sender` and `recipient`: Unique IDs of the sender and recipient accounts.\n","- `amount`: The value being transferred.\n","- `id`: A unique identifier for the transaction.\n","- `timestamp`: A UNIX timestamp marking when the transaction was created.\n","\n","Transactions are validated before being added to the pending pool. Validation ensures that the sender has sufficient balance, and any invalid transaction is rejected.\n","\n","## 5. **Merkle Tree**\n","The Merkle Tree is used to generate a single cryptographic hash (the Merkle Root) representing all transactions in a block.\n","\n","## 6. **Miners**\n","Miners are modeled as specialized accounts with computational resources (`resources`) initilased randomly that simulate their hashing power. Mining efficiency is proportional to the `resources` attribute, influencing the time required to compute a valid hash.\n","\n","## 7. **Mining and Proof-of-Work**\n","Mining implements a simplified proof-of-work algorithm where miners search for a `nonce` such that the block's hash is numerically smaller than a predefined target (`difficulty`). The process involves:\n","1. Constructing the block header, which includes:\n","   - `previous_hash`\n","   - `merkle_root`\n","   - `timestamp`\n","   - `difficulty`\n","   - `nonce`\n","2. Iteratively hashing the block header with different nonce values.\n","3. Verifying whether the resulting hash satisfies the target condition.\n","\n","The first miner to find a valid nonce get a reward of 10 Alicoins (10 @), ensuring fair incentives.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sLIHoou2K0J9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import hashlib\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from random import randint\n","import random\n","import time\n","from multiprocessing import Process, Value, Queue\n","\n","class MerkleTree:\n","    def __init__(self, files):\n","        #
